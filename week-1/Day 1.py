# I completed all the lessons till Python casting in w3 schools along with exercises.
# Watched the video mentioned in my 3 month bootcamp till 40 minutes time stamp completing all the concepts till working with strings. Will watch more of it tomorrow and complete at least the calculator project.

# VARIABLE NOTES 
#Variable = A variable is a container for values like strings, integer, float and booleans. Variables are Case Sensitive.

#STRING
Name = "Sharry"
Food = "Subway"
Age = "19"

#I'm using f-string here
print(f"My Name is {Name}")
print(f"My favourite food is {Food} and Chocolate cookies") #Basically Anything B/w these "" is a String.
print(type(Name))
#INTEGER

age = 19
currency = 25

print(f"My age is {age}")
print(f"You are paying {currency:.2f} bucks") # :.nf is used to add decimals after an integer, where n = amount of decimals u want.
print(type(age))
